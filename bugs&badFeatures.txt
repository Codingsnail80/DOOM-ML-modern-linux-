Currently there are some bugs with the code including the down arrow key causes the player to accelerate very fast. Also "," causes the player to strafe fast. (only on some devices)
The audio also needs to be fixed.
The screen size is honestly terrible and needs to be changed later.
Also I would like there to be movement with the wasd keys and mouse movement instead of arrow keys.
